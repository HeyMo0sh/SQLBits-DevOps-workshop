# SQL projects and source control integration for SQL in Fabric, Azure SQL, and SQL Server

## Summary

This workshop is a deep dive on database DevOps centered on the SQL database projects format, where you will learn practical techniques for managing database changes whether your workload is operational, analytical, or somewhere in between. Our exploration begins with the foundational CI/CD capabilities for SQL projects, where you can ensure no matter how a database is developed it is in source control and can be verified before deployments to one or more environments. The same shared SQL projects format applies to the whole Microsoft SQL family, so we'll examine the advantages and special capabilities to understand when implementing DevOps practices for Fabric SQL, Azure SQL, or SQL Server. We conclude our workshop with some special topics at the core of good data DevOps practices, including security management, static data management, and coordinating changes with other workloads.

## SQL Server Details

- Server:      sqlbits.database.windows.net
- Admin:       sqladmin
- Password:    2025SQLbits4U

## CodeSpace Install of SQLPACKAGE & .NET SDK

### .NET SDK

1. To install the .NET 8 SDK in a Codespace, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal in your Codespace.
1. Download and install the .NET 8 SDK using the official Microsoft installation script:

``` bash
wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O dotnet-install.sh
chmod +x dotnet-install.sh
./dotnet-install.sh --channel 8.0
```

1. Add the installed .NET tools to your PATH:

``` bash
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.dotnet
```

1. Verify the installation:

``` bash
dotnet --version
```

### SQLPACKAGE

1. To install sqlpackage in your Codespace (Linux), follow these steps in the terminal:

``` bash
wget https://aka.ms/sqlpackage-linux -O sqlpackage.zip
```

1. Extract the zip file:

```bash
unzip sqlpackage.zip -d sqlpackage
```

1. Move sqlpackage to a directory in your PATH (e.g., /usr/local/bin):

```bash
sudo mv sqlpackage /opt/sqlpackage
sudo chmod +x /opt/sqlpackage/sqlpackage
sudo ln -s /opt/sqlpackage/sqlpackage /usr/local/bin/sqlpackage
```

1. Verify the installation:

``` bash
sqlpackage -?
````
